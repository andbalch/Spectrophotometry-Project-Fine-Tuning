# Descripion
This repo is an automated analysis pipeline for the experimental procedure described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qBUqAkQoyPVcTV9zNvf5FTzEnq1tB9hjfN2Cr519-Wc/edit?pli=1#bookmark=id.e9guvr2687om) to fine tune experimental and analysis parameters for future work. It replicates an [existing process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qBUqAkQoyPVcTV9zNvf5FTzEnq1tB9hjfN2Cr519-Wc/edit?pli=1#bookmark=id.ntbrn8gnxcwd) that used ImageJ and Excel, but was too manual to test parameters in this experiment. 

# Usage
1. Ensure Jupyter notebooks are set up on your system
2. Clone repo 
3. Install requirements in requirements.txt (ideally within a conda virtual environment using "conda create --name <\env> --file requirements.txt", but "pip install -r requirements.txt" can also be used)
